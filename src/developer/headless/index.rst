Go headless
===========

Since Roadiz v1.6, you can create a 100% *headless* project using:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create a new Roadiz project
    composer create-project roadiz/headless-edition myheadless_project

No more theme, just business logic
----------------------------------

**Headless edition get rid of themes** logic in favor of a simple ``src/`` folder
to add custom business logic. All API features are handled by *AbstractApiTheme* which is
registered as a *composer* dependency and in your ``src/AppKernel.php`` file.

.. code-block:: php

    # src/AppKernel.php
    public function register(Container $container): void
    {
        parent::register($container);
        // Headless edition: do not remove API services
        $container->register(new \Themes\AbstractApiTheme\Services\AbstractApiServiceProvider());
        $container->register(new \App\AppServiceProvider());

        /*
         * Add your own service providers.
         */
    }

Headless structure
------------------

* ``bin/``: Contains the Roadiz CLI executable
* ``docker/``: Tools for creating development and production *Docker* image for your project
* ``app/``: Contains every runtime resources from configuration to app cache and nodes-sources entities

    * ``cache/``: Every cache file for *Twig* templates and `Intervention Request <https://github.com/roadiz/roadiz/releases>`_ images (this folder must be writable for PHP)
    * ``conf/``: Your setup configuration file(s) (this folder must be writable for PHP)
    * ``gen-src/``: Generated PHP code for Doctrine and your Node-types entities (this folder must be writable for PHP)
    * ``logs/``: *Monolog* logs folder

* ``files/``: Private documents and font files root (this folder must be writable for PHP)
* ``samples/``: This folder contains useful configuration and example files for Apache or Nginx webservers
* ``web/``: Your website root, it contains your application entry-points and your public assets

    * ``files/``: Public documents (this folder must be writable for PHP)
    * ``themes/``: public assets mirror for each theme, this folder contains symlinks to your ``themes/YourTheme/static`` folder

* ``src/``: Contains all your website logic
* ``vendor/``: Dependencies folder managed by *Composer*

Configure CORS
--------------

.. code-block:: php

    # src/AppServiceProvider.php
    /**
     * @return array
     */
    $container['api.cors_options'] = [
        'allow_credentials' => true,
        // Allow all origin or defines some regex domains
        'allow_origin' => ['*'],
        'allow_headers' => true,
        'origin_regex' => false,
        'allow_methods' => ['GET'],
        // Expose Link header for NuxtJS to resolve other translations
        'expose_headers' => ['Link'],
        'max_age' => 60*60*24
    ];

API usage and authentication
----------------------------

API endpoints are described in detail in `AbstractApiTheme <https://github.com/roadiz/AbstractApiTheme#generic-roadiz-api>`_  repository README. You'll get automatic:

* Collection listing for all nodes-sources
* Collection listing per node-type
* Single item endpoint
* User endpoint
* â€¦

All with query-string parameters for searching and filtering JSON output.

API can be accessed using:

* Simple ``X-Api-Key`` access per application for non-user related content
* Or **OAuth2** applications with ``client_credentials`` or ``authorization_code`` grant types.
