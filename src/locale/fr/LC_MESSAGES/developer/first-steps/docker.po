"Roadiz standard edition is shipped with a ``docker-compose`` example "
"environment ready to use for development. *Docker* on Linux will provide "
"awesome performances and a production-like environment without bloating "
"your development machine. Performances won't be as good on *macOS* or "
"*Windows* hosts, but it will prevent installing singled versioned PHP and"
" MySQL directly on your computer."
