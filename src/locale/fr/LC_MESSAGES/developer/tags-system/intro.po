"Nodes are essentially hierarchical entities. So we created an entity to "
"link nodes between them no matter where/what they are. Tags are meant as "
"*tag* nodes, we couldn’t be more explicit. But if you didn’t understand "
"here is a schema:"

"You can see that tags can gather heterogenous nodes coming from different"
" types (pages and projects). Tags can be used to display a category-"
"navigation on your theme or to simply tidy your backoffice node database."

"need to, we encourage you to create two different nodes."
