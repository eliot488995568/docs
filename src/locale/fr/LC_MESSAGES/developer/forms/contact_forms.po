"With Roadiz you can easily create simple contact forms with "
"``ContactFormManager`` class. Your controller has a convenient shortcut "
"to create this manager with ``$this->createContactFormManager()`` method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../developer/forms/contact_forms.rst:10
msgid ""
"If you want to add your own fields, you can use the manager’ form-builder"
" with ``$contactFormManager->getFormBuilder();``. Then add your field "
"using standard *Symfony* form syntax. Do not forget to use *Constraints* "
"to handle errors."

msgid ""
"In this example, we used ``withDefaultFields`` method which add "
"automatically ``email``, ``name`` and ``message`` fields with right "
"validation contraints. This method is optional and you can add any field "
"you want manually, just keep in mind that you should always ask for an "
"``email``."

msgid ""
"If you want to use *contact-forms* in blocks instead of a full page, you "
"will need to make your redirection response **bubble** through *Twig* "
"render. The only way to stop Twig is to **throw an exception** and to "
"pass your Redirect or Json response within your Exception."
msgstr ""

#: ../../developer/forms/contact_forms.rst:109
msgid ""
"Roadiz makes this possible with "
"``RZ\\Roadiz\\Core\\Exceptions\\ForceResponseException``. For example, in"
" a "
"``Themes\\MyAwesomeTheme\\Controllers\\Blocks\\ContactBlockController``, "
"instead of returning the ``contactFormManager`` response, you will have "
"to throw a ``ForceResponseException`` with it as an argument."
msgstr ""

#: ../../developer/forms/contact_forms.rst:140
msgid ""
"Then, in your *master* controller (i.e. ``PageController``), ``render`` "
"method will automatically catch your *ForceResponseException* exception "
"in order to extract the forced response object. Then it will return your "
"response instead of your page twig rendered output."

"Roadiz can seamlessly use *Google reCAPTCHA* to secure your contact form "
"against robots. All you need to do is to register on "
"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ to ask for a *sitekey* and a *secret*. "
"Once you’ve got these two keys, add them to your Roadiz settings."
