"If you developed a new feature or simply want to try out an installation "

"You have to run unit-tests on a dedicated database not to lose any "
"existing Roadiz website. You can create a ``conf/config_test.yml`` YAML "
"configuration which will be read only for this environment. Then, wire "
"this configuration to a blank database. Unit-tests can be launched by the"

"If your are writing a feature, don't forget to write a unit test for it. "
"You can find some example in the folder ``tests``. In Roadiz, there are 4"
" types of tests:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../developer/contributing.rst:39
msgid ""
"Standard tests which must extend ``\\PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase``. These "
"tests should only test simple logic methods and classes as they won’t "
"require Roadiz kernel to boot up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../developer/contributing.rst:40
msgid ""
"Kernel dependent tests which must extend "
"`RZ\\Roadiz\\Tests\\KernelDependentCase``. These tests should only test "
"logic classes and methods inside Roadiz kernel without any database "
"concern."
msgstr ""

#: ../../developer/contributing.rst:41
msgid ""
"Schema dependent tests which must extend "
"``RZ\\Roadiz\\Tests\\SchemaDependentCase``. These tests should only test "
"low level database methods and classes without relying on node-types or "
"translations. Use this type of testing if you want to test Roadiz "
"entities and repositories methods except for Nodes and NodeTypes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../developer/contributing.rst:42
msgid ""
"DefaultTheme dependent tests which must extend "
"``RZ\\Roadiz\\Tests\\DefaultThemeDependentCase``. These tests rely on a "
"complete Roadiz installation with existing node-types and translation. "
"They are longer to prepare as PHPUnit must install a fresh Roadiz with "
"DefaultTheme at each case."
msgstr ""

#: ../../developer/contributing.rst:45
msgid ""
"Each ``SchemaDependentCase`` and ``DefaultThemeDependentCase`` will "
"provision a fresh Roadiz database then drop it. Make sure to use a "
"dedicated database. If you execute unit-tests from an existing Roadiz "
"website, you’ll have to run ``bin/roadiz generate:nsentities`` at the end"
" of your testing session to build your NodesSources classes again (every "
"environment share the same ``gen-src`` folder)."

"The code you contributed to the project should respect the guidelines "

"Please take those rules into account, we aim to have a clean codebase. A "
