User documentation
==================

.. note ::
    **User documentation is on the way.**
    We invite you to send us questions on our `Gitter account <https://gitter.im/roadiz/roadiz>`_ or
    to leave some documentation suggestions on our `Github repository <https://github.com/roadiz/docs/issues>`_.

First of all, you will need to connect to Roadizâ€™ backoffice in order to make changes to your website
contents. To connect, you just have to write ``/rz-admin`` after your website domain name, in your browser address bar.
Then you will be able to enter your username and password that you chose during Roadiz installation
or that you received by email.

Here you can choose to keep your connection active for a couple of days, if your browser accepts cookies.

If you forgot your credentials, the *Forgot password?* section will ask you an email to send you a
password reset link.
