================================
Welcome to Roadiz documentation!
================================

Roadiz is a polymorphic CMS based on a node system that can handle many types of services.
It is based on *Symfony* framework, *Doctrine ORM*, *API Platform* and *Twig* for maximum performances and security.

Roadiz node system allows you to create your data schema and to organize your content as you want.
We designed it to break technical constraints when you create tailor-made websites architectures and layouts.

Imagine you need to display your graphic design portfolio and… sell some t-shirts. With Roadiz you will be able to
create your content forms from scratch and choose the right fields you need. Images and texts for your projects.
Images, texts, prices and even geolocation for your products. That’s why it’s called *polymorphic*.

Philosophy
----------

When discovering Roadiz back-office interface, you will notice that there aren’t any Rich text editor also called *WYSIWYG* editors.
We chose to promote *Markdown* syntax in order to focus on content hierarchy and quality
instead of content style. Our guideline is to preserve and respect the web-designers and graphic designers work.

You’ll see that we built Roadiz as web-designers and for web-designers. It will allow you to create really quickly website
prototypes using *Twig* templates or develop complex headless websites with the power of *API Platform*.

We want Roadiz to be a great tool for designers and developers to build strong web experiences together.
But we thought of editors too! Roadiz back-office theme “Rozier” has been designed to offer every back-users a
great writing and administrating experience.
