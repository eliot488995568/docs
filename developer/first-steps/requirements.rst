.. _requirements:

Roadiz is a web application running with PHP. It requires an HTTP server for static assets and **SSH access** with out/ingoing allowed connections.
Here is a short summary of mandatory elements before installing Roadiz:

* Nginx or Apache, with a dedicated virtual host as described below.
* PHP 5.6+ **required**, PHP 7+ *recommended*
* ``php-gd`` extension
* ``php-intl`` extension
* ``php-xml`` extension
* ``php-curl`` extension
* JSON needs to be enabled
* ctype needs to be enabled
* Your php.ini needs to have the ``date.timezone`` setting
* You need to have at least version 2.6.21 of libxml
* PHP tokenizer needs to be enabled
* mbstring functions need to be enabled
* PHP *OPcache* + *APCu* (APC 3.0.17+ or another opcode cache needs to be installed)
* php.ini recommended settings
    * ``short_open_tag = Off``
    * ``magic_quotes_gpc = Off``
    * ``register_globals = Off``
    * ``session.auto_start = Off``
* MariaDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL or SQLite database (do not forget to install ``php-xxxsql`` extension according to your database driver flavor)
* Zip/Unzip
* cUrl
* Composer
* Git

.. note::
    If you are using a *shared hosting plan*, make sure that your serverâ€™s SSH connection allows external connections. You can verify with a simple ``ping google.com``.
    If you get request timeouts, your hosting provider might be blocking your SSH connectivity.
    You should consider using at least a VPS-like hosting.
    If you really need to setup Roadiz on a simple shared-hosting plan, we encourage you to install it on your own computer and send it with SFTP/FTP (it might take a long time) or *rsync* it.

For Nginx users
---------------

If you are using Nginx, you donâ€™t have to enable any extensions.
You only need to create your *virtual host* using our example file ``/samples/nginx.conf``.

For Apache users
----------------

If you are using *Apache* do not forget to enable these mods:

* ``mod_rewrite``: enabling Roadiz front-controller system.
* ``mod_expires``: enabling http cache headers on static assets.

And do not use built-in ``mod_php``, prefer *PHP-FPM* ðŸ˜‰!

Then use ``/samples/apache.conf`` template to create your *virtual host* configuration file. It shows how to set rewrite and
secure private folders from being viewed from public visitors.

If you do not have access to your Apache virtual host configuration, you can use the built-in *htaccess* generator:

``bin/roadiz generate:htaccess``

This command will generate ``.htaccess`` files in each critical folder to enable PHP scripts or deny public access to forbidden folders.

.. topic:: Standard Edition

    ``bin/roadiz generate:htaccess`` is not needed anymore with *Roadiz Standard edition* as you will
    configure your *Apache/Nginx* root to ``web/`` folder only. No source or configuration files will be
    exposed anymore.
