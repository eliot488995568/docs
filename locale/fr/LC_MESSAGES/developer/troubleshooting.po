"If you experience errors only on a dedicated environment such as "
"``prod``, ``dev`` or ``install``, it means that cache is not fresh for "
"these environments. As a first try, you should always call ``bin/roadiz "
"cache:clear -e prod;`` (replace *prod* by your environment) in command "
"line."

"If you still get errors from a specific env and you are using an *OPcode*"

"If you are using a *OPCode var cache* like *APC*, *XCache*, you should "

"If you are behind a reverse-proxy like *Varnish* or *Nginx proxy* on a "
"*Docker* environment, IP addresses, domain name and proto (https/http) "

"If you have some weird errors about `void` keywords and methods "

"or *return types*."
