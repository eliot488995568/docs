"Nodes are essentially hierarchical entities. So we created an entity to "
"link nodes between them no matter where/what they are. Tags are meant as "
"*tag* nodes, we couldn’t be more explicit. But if you didn’t understand "
"here is a schema:"

"You can see that tags can gather heterogenous nodes coming from different"
" types (pages and projects). Tags can be used to display a category-"
"navigation on your theme or to simply tidy your backoffice node database."

"Did you notice that ``Tags`` are related to ``Nodes`` entities, not "
"``NodesSources``? We thought that it would be easier to manage that way "
"not to forget to tag a specific node translation. It means that you won’t"
" be able to differenciate tag two ``NodesSources``, if you absolutely "
"need to, we encourage you to create two different nodes."

"You will notice that tags work the same way as nodes do. By default, tags"
" names can’t contain special characters in order to be used in URLs. So "
"we created ``TagTranslation`` entities which stand for Tag’s sources:"
