"First you will have to setup properly your server virtual host. You can "

"**For shared hosting plan owners**, if you can’t modify your virtual host"
" definition, don’t panic, Roadiz has a built-in CLI command to generate "
"``.htaccess`` files for you. Just execute ``bin/roadiz "
"generate:htaccess`` after cloning Roadiz sources and running Composer. In"
" the other hand, if you are using *Apache* and have access to your "
"virtual host, we strongly recommend you to use our sample configuration "
"and disable ``.htaccess`` files: performances are at their best without "
"them."

"When you transfer your Roadiz site via FTP make sure ``.htaccess`` files "

"Once you unzipped and moved your Roadiz files into your webserver folder,"

"You have to understand that using Zip archive way with FTP transfers will"
" make updating Roadiz harder. If you have a dedicated server or a VPS, we"
