msgid "*Composer* will prompt you if you want to can versioning history. Choose the default answer ``no`` as we definitely want to replace *roadiz/skeleton* *Git* with our own versioning. Then you will be able to customize every files in your projects and save them using Git, not only your theme. Of course we added a default ``.gitignore`` file to prevent your configuration setting and entry points to be committed in your *Git* history. That way you can have different configuration on development and on your production server without bothering about merge conflicts."
